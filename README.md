Here's an implementation of the famous GOLD FINGER counter, using LESS.

You may be familiar with this if you interviewed for a web developer position in the early / mid-2010s.

There are two core files:
- goldfinger.jade >> Jade template file compiled to goldfinger.html (using JADE)
- goldfinger.less >> LESS file compiled to goldfinger.css (using GULP)
